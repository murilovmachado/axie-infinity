### Expectations and day-to-day Activities
- You get one vacation day every 2 weeks;
  - If you will be inactive for some reason, please contact the manager;

  - Create your own Ronin Wallet;
- You get 50% percent of all SLP you earn;
  - Including bonus SLP (e.g. Bosses);
- Payments are the 15th and 30th of the month;
- Except the first payment, that's only after you earn 3.000 SLP;
  - You don't need to reach 150 SLP during this time, so use it to learn more about the game: search online for the best strategies, watch other people play and ask the manager for advice.
